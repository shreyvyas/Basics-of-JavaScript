console.log("Hello World")    //print in javascript

let a = 4                     //assigning variable
console.log(a)                
 
console.log(typeof(a))         //printing type of variable

//var, let and const are the types of variables
//we can define like let a = 2, var b = 3, const c = 4

//let a = 5  redeclaration is not allowed with let keyword
//with var keyword it is allowed
//reassignment is allowed with let keyword. e.g. below :
a = 5
console.log(a)

var b = "shrey"
console.log(b)

var b = "Anagh"
console.log(b)

//reassignment and redeclaration is not allowed with const

const d = 10
//d = 30
console.log(d)
